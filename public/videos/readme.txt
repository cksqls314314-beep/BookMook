Place your custom hero video file here.

Filename suggestion: waves.mp4

To use a drone-shot video of waves as your site hero background, save your
video as `waves.mp4` in this folder. The landing page will load and play
this file automatically.

You can replace `waves.mp4` with any other MP4 video, as long as you update
the `video` prop in `HeroVideo` usage within `app/page.tsx` accordingly.
